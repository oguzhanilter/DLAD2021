---- Notes
	tmux [olter_1] : 
	-> cd ~/code -> source activate pytorch_latest_p37 ->  pip install -r requirements.txt
	--- now sourced the env and installed all requirements
	
	-> No need all above ... 
		aws_start_instance.py --bare to start instance without start the a training.
		to start training source aws_train_in_tmux.sh -> this will source aws_train.sh
		aws_train.sh contains parameters. Many training can be started one after another by simply 
		putting the 
		python -m mtl.scripts.train \
  		--log_dir /home/ubuntu/results/ \
		--dataset_root /home/ubuntu/miniscapes/ \
		--name Default \
		--optimizer sgd \
		--optimizer_lr 0.1
		
		repeatedly. Check the line 23 and 32! 
		
		!!! Note that a instance will be closed when the aws_train.sh has been executed or after 24 hours since
		it is set to do so (24h can be changed in aws_start_instance.py)
